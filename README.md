After a night of sleep, your energy level is low and your body needs new energy to function properly. Your body gets this new energy from a nutritious breakfast. Food is the most important energy source for your body. You can think of food as fuel for your body. 

Breaktasty is a recipe website for people who love breakfasts. The website is a place where people (especially breakfast lovers) can get inspired, search for tasty recipes and post their recipes. 

Breaktasty is designed to inspire people for breakfast ideas. Everyone is welcome to create an account and add their breakfast recipes. If the user has an account, he/she can add, edit and delete their recipes. And they can save other recipes by putting them in favorites. 

This project is the third out of four Milestone Projects in the Full Stack Web Development Program I am attending at The Code Institute.

<h1>1. User experience (UX)</h1>

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project goals 

- Making a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. 
- Making a full-stack site that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and MongoDB.

- Creating a website that serves as a platform where people can get inspired for breakfast ideas and where they can share their breakfast recipes. 
- Creating a website that is simple to understand and easy to navigate.
- The users of the website can make use of CRUD (create, read, update and delete) for the recipes. 

<span id="ux-stories"></span>

### 1.2 User stories 

**First-time visitor goals:**
1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to visit the website on every device, so that I can look at the website on desktop, mobile and tablet. 
2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through the website, so I can find everything easily. 
3. As a first time visitor, I want to see an overview of all recipes, so I can get inspired by all recipes.
4. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to search recipes by categories, so I can quickly scan the recipes by category. 
5. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to search recipes based on words, so I can find recipes easily. (For example, I can search the word banana and all recipes with the ingredient Banana or banana in the recipe name will appear.)
6. As a first time visitor, I want to register an account on the website, so I can share my recipes on Breaktasty. 
7. As a first time visitor, I want to sign up for the newsletter. 

**Site member goals:** 

All the goals of first-time visitors also apply for site members. There are additional user stories to the site members because they have more access to the website. See the additional user stories below. 
1. As a site member, I want to add my recipes, so I can share my recipes. 
2. As a site member, I want to edit my recipes, so I can update information in the recipe.
3. As a site member, I want to delete my recipes, so I can remove the recipe when it is no longer relevant. 
4. As a site member, I want to login to my profile, so I have access to my recipes. 
5. As a site member, I want to logout to my profile, so I can logout from my profile. 


**Admin goals:**

All the goals of the first time visitors and site members also apply for the admin. The admin has additional user stories to manage the categories of the recipes. 
1. As an admin, I want to add new categories, so I can make the categories clear and manageable. 
2. As an admin, I want to edit categories, so I can update categories. 
3. As an admin, I want to delete categories, so I can remove categories when they are no longer relevant.

### 1.3 Design 

- #### Colour scheme 
The three colours that are used for the recipe website are very neutral and simple. I have chosen these colours because the colours give a sleek and uncluttered appearance. 

![Colour scheme](readme_img/colours.png)

- **The black colour** is used for the social media navbar, a section of the footer, the flash messages, all text and some highlighted rows. 
- **The grey colour** is used for a section in the footer. In this section the user can sign up for the newsletter and some information is given about the purpose of the website. This section is grey to highlight the section and makes it soften in contrast to the black colour. 
- **The white colour** is the background of the body. This white colour makes all content on the body look clear and calm. 

- #### Fonts
The **Bebas Neue font** and **Raleway font** are used throughout the whole website. Sans serif and cursive are the fallbacks in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. The Bebas Neue font is used for all titles, the instruction text, the recipes names, ingredients and other special text that should stand out more. This font is used because the font is all in capital letters and has a sleek appearance. The Raleway font is used for all paragraph text. This font is used because it is easy to read and matches well with the Bebas Neue font. 

- #### Icons
In the project, icons are used that are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The Icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu and social media icons. 

- #### Images
The images I used for this project came from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). Images are used for the header on the home page and all the recipes. 

- #### Defensive design 

    - The user is not able to break the site by clicking on buttons. 
    - The signup form: 
        - The username has to be between 5-20 characters and only must contain letters and numbers. 
        - The password has to be between 5-20 characters and must contain at least one number, and one uppercase and lowercase letter.
    - The add and edit recipe form:
     - The recipe name has to be between 1-20 characters and only must contain letters and numbers
        - The category has to be chosen.
        - The image URL must start with http:// or https://.
        - The number of serves and prepping time has to be numbered.
    - By the email subscriber, the email must be in the following order: characters followed by a @ symbol, followed by more characters and then a “.”.
    - A recipe or category can't be deleted by just one click. If someone clicks on the delete button, there wil be a pop up with a confirmation if someone is sure to delete the recipe or category.

- #### Interactive design 

    - The website has to be easy to navigate. 
    - The user can quickly find the information he/she wants to find.
